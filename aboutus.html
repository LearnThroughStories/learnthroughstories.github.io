      <h2 style="text-align: start;"> About LeTS </h2>
      The Learn Through Stories Foundation enables students to learn through content they have themselves helped
      produce.
    </div>

    <div class="about">

      <strong>LETS.</strong> In 2014, Prof. Alka Hingorani of IIT Bombay answered a call from a couple of schools in
      remote villages in Himachal Pradesh to help their students learn English. She started the “Learn English Through
      Stories” (LETS) project to address two problems: a) that the language was unfamiliar and seldom heard in those
      areas, and b) that available pedagogies were rooted in urban/Western contexts, too alien to the land. Her team
      found that when encouraged and trained to draw and tell their own favourite stories, the students were immensely
      animated and engaged. When these very stories were turned into illustrated books and translated into English,
      much in it was familiar, and the newness of the language became the only bridge to cross.
    </div>

    <div class="about">
      <span class="floater"><img src="assets/img/about-umesh.png" title="Umesh Wagh recording student voice"></span>
      <strong>From LETS to LeTS.</strong> Language wasn’t the only thing they were learning. In collaborating with
      each other, with professional designers and artists, sharing equal authorship credit, and writing themselves
      into the material from which they learned, they flipped the script: learners became teachers,

      and consumers were
      transformed into creators of content. Similar workshops for teachers wrought their own magic, equipping them
      with newer tools and helping them participate in creating new content, new confidence. Everywhere, process was
      paramount, and the realization that it was subject-agnostic meant that the ‘E’ in our name could be knocked down
      to ‘e’ – we are now Learn Through Stories (LeTS).
    </div>

    <div class="about">
      <strong>LeTS Foundation.</strong> In 2021, Gayathri Thakoor and Prof. Arti Kalro, who had long been friends of
      the project, became instrumental in starting the Learn Through Stories Foundation (a not-for-profit endeavour)
      to take the project out of its research confines and into the wider world.
    </div>

    <div class="about">
      <strong>What we do.</strong> Today, the LeTS Foundation conducts content-creation workshops, collects contextual
      stories from schools in India, both rural and urban, teaches book design and production, and publishes books
      that then return to all students and teachers. Our work involves a team of designers and includes a curated
      process, physical story books, and their digital parallels in animation films and interactive applications.
      Meanwhile, research continues apace at IIT Bombay.

          <strong>Gayathri Thakoor</strong> is co-founder and CEO of Learn Through Stories (LeTS) Foundation. A
          published author,
          manager, and entrepreneur over a career graph of 25 years, her role as a news journalist sharing stories
          formed the base of it all. She then co-founded a business enterprise to develop literature for children, and
          create animated characters that were copyrighted to feature in illustrated picture books and in digital
          media. Gayathri’s experience as General Manager (Programs) with the Tata
          Centre for Technology and Design, IIT Bombay, brought her close to the LETS project – the genesis of this
          social
          enterprise. Taking the best out of her experiences, she believes
          collaboration is key. Her blog - Affectionately G – helps her keep in touch with readers
          through diary entries and letters. Gayathri holds two postgraduate degrees in Education and in Business
          Administration, and a graduate degree in Economics.

          <strong>Arti Kalro</strong> is faculty in the Shailesh J Mehta School of Management at IIT Bombay. Her areas
          of expertise
          include Marketing and Social Innovations. While designing and teaching the course, Technology and Design for
          End-to-End Innovations for resource-constrained communities, she worked with Alka as co-PI on impact
          assessment
          of the project and, with Gayathri, is now working on making the dream of the LeTS' vision a reality for every
          child in India. When
          Arti isn’t teaching or racking her brain on scaling-up LeTS, she is busy (and immensely happy) spending time
          with
          children, getting their hands dirty with paint and clay.
