<h1>Privacy Policy for Learn Through Stories Foundation</h1>
<p>Last updated: Aug 16, 2022</p>

<p>The Learn Through Stories Foundation (accessible from <a href="https://learnthroughstories.org">learnthroughstories.org</a>), hereby known as LeTS, is a not-for-profit organization focussed on child and young-adult education through collaborative storytelling. We help children become co-authors and co-illustrators along with experienced design professionals.

<p> We value the privacy of all visitors -- children and adults -- to the website, and of the users in all the mobile applications developed by us (LeTS ReadAloud). By using our website and our mobile apps, you hereby consent to the following Privacy Policy and agree to its terms. </p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to our online/mobile app activities. It is not applicable to any information collected offline or other channels. The text of this document may change as we introduce new interactive functionality, but the changes will be entirely within the spirit of this document. Please check the date of last update at the top of this document.</p>
